Collections are a way to list resources around a theme, relevant to a research agenda or set of papers, or as an introduction to various aspects of the field. They are formatted in markdown:

## titles should be formatted with 2 hash symbols (a single-hash title is reserved for page titles)

* bullet points formatted with a star
	* secondary bullets are tabbed in

If you would like to list a dataset that's recorded in the I3 index, you can use a relative link, e.g.

```markdown
[local dataset name](/datasets/dataset_shortname)
```

Dataset shortnames can be found either by looking at the urls directly, or through the 'shortnames' column of the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdyhGrj0oNz-_qW3Rv2GNGqhZZ73rgj-DYWePLA_1Ms/edit#gid=1389884911).
