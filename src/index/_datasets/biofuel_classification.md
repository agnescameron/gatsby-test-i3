description: 'Through use of natural language processing and machine-learning algorithms,
  we expand patent classification capabilities to better explain the history of biofuels
  innovation.


  This NLP model was generated using the Stanford NLP Classifier (available from:
  http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/classifier.shtml). The model was trained using
  a random selection of 700 manually classified biofuel patents from 1976 through
  2013, and validated against 300 manually classified biofuel patents on January 03,
  2014. Included are the classification results and associated patent numbers for
  both the manually trained patents, and for the automatically categorized patents.
