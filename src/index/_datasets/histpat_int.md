description: 'HistPat International provides the geography of historical patents granted
  to foreign nationals by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from
  1836 to 1975. This historical dataset is constructed using digitalized records of
  original patent documents that are publicly available. HistPat can be used in different
  disciplines ranging from geography, economics, history, network science, and science
  and technology studies. Additionally, it can easily be merged with post-1975 USPTO
  digital patent data to extend it until today. '
