description: 'We propose a new measure of the economic importance of each innovation.
  Our measure uses newly collected data on patents issued to U.S. firms in the 1926
  to 2010 period, combined with the stock market response to news about patents. Our
  patent-level estimates of private economic value are positively related to the scientific
  value of these patents, as measured by the number of citations the patent receives
  in the future.


  This data provides an updated data series for KPSS values and forward citations,
  a patent number to the CRSP "permno" match and a patent number to CPC class match.'
