description: "Each edition of the Orange Book provides a snapshot of unexpired patent\
  \ protection at a moment in time. As patents on a drug expire and new patents are\
  \ issued, these changes are reflected in later editions. The Orange Book also provides\
  \ a snapshot of unexpired regulatory exclusivity granted by the FDA. For example,\
  \ certain novel drugs receive five years of regulatory exclusivity that blocks the\
  \ entry of generic competition, even in the absence of any patents. Combining multiple\
  \ editions reveals a comprehensive picture of patent and regulatory protection as\
  \ it evolves over a drug’s lifecycle. These data files provide digital versions\
  \ of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Orange Book patent and exclusivity\
  \ tables for years 1985-2016 (no Orange Book was published in 1986). \n\nPDF versions\
  \ of the Orange Books were obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request,\
  \ and data from these PDF files was either hand-entered or parsed in order to create\
  \ the digital files."
