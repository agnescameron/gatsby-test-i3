description: 'The USPTO Cancer Moonshot Patent Data contains detailed information
  on published patent applications and granted patents relevant to cancer research
  and development (R&D). We generate the dataset using USPTO examiner tools to execute
  a series of queries designed to identify cancer-specific patents and patent applications.
  We apply several approaches to ensure coverage of the various fields and subject
  matter that cancer-related innovations encompass. These include drugs, diagnostics,
  surgical devices, data analytics, and genomic-based inventions. The final dataset
  consist of roughly 270,000 patent documents spanning the 1976 to 2016 period. '
