The Biospolar project aimed to identify research and innovation involving Antarctic biodiversity. As part of the project large datasets were created of the scientific literature and patent data for the Antarctic using the [open access Lens database](https://www.lens.org/). This OSF repository provides public access to those datasets for further research. Data is provided as csv files and larger datasets are zipped using bzip.

Datasets

The datasets are divided into three sections:

* [Literature](https://osf.io/6ntxu/)
* [Patents](https://osf.io/kwtz6/)
* [Taxonomy](https://osf.io/wvesr/)

## Lens Public Collections

You can access dynamic versions of the data by visiting the online public collections at the Lens. Each collection can be search and downloaded. The available collections are:

### Literature

* [Antarctic Biodiversity Literature Collection](https://www.lens.org/lens/scholar/search/results?collectionId=170883) with 25,468 publications.
* [Antarctic Bioprospecting Literature](https://www.lens.org/lens/scholar/search/results?collectionId=179815) with 98 publications.
* [Antarctic Biodiversity Literature with Patent Citations](https://www.lens.org/lens/scholar/search/results?collectionId=179816) with 796 publications.

### Patent Data

* [Raw patent data on Antarctica](https://www.lens.org/lens/collection/179814), 29,690 documents
* [Antarctic Species](https://www.lens.org/lens/collection/180935) with 2,738 first filings containing a verifiable Antarctic species. Be aware that this set will include incidences of E. coli as discussed in the paper where it co-occurs with references to Antarctica.
* [Antarctic Krill first filings](https://www.lens.org/lens/collection/179390). The 150 first filings examined in the paper, with 1,0193 family members. Refers to filings mentioning Antarctic krill or Euphausia superba inside the Antarctic dataset. Note that this dataset is dynamic and expansion of patent family members may reveal more documents than listed in the paper.
* [Krill Collection](https://www.lens.org/lens/collection/170873). A patent collection with 8,165 documents worldwide from 4,010 patent families with the term krill in the title, abstract, description or claims.
* [Antarctic species and places](https://www.lens.org/lens/collection/179659). A collection consisting of 267 raw families (not reduced to first filings) and an Antarctic place name. Dominated by references to Antarctic/Antarctica.
