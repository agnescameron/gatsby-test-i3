description: 'The European Business Performance database describes the performance
  of the largest enterprises in the twentieth century. It covers eight countries that
  together consistently account for above 80 per cent of western European GDP: Great
  Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Finland. Data have
  been collected for five benchmark years, namely on the eve of WWI (1913), before
  the Great Depression (1927), at the extremes of the golden age (1954 and 1972),
  and in 2000.'
