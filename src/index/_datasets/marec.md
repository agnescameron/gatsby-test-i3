description: 'MAREC Data is a static collection of over 19 million patent applications
  and granted patents in a unified file format normalized from EP, WO, US, and JP
  sources, spanning a range from 1976 to June 2008. In MAREC, the documents from different
  countries and sources are normalized to a common XML format with a uniform patent
  numbering scheme and citation format. The standardized fields include dates, countries,
  languages, references, person names, and companies as well as rich subject classifications.
  It is a comparable corpus, where many documents are available in similar versions
  in other languages. '
