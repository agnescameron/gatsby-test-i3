We use information about U.S. residing inventors from patents which include name and location and search for age and date of death information from publicly available online web directories and build a scoring system to indicate the quality of information that we collect. After applying a variety of heuristics and robustness checks, we find 1,508,676 inventor ages. We also find the death dates of 206,589 inventors, though are not as confident in its accuracy.
