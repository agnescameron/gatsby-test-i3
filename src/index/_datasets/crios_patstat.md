description: "Disambiguated inventor's and applicant's names for EPO records. A major
  problem with PATSTAT was that data are provided in a raw format. Data have been
  therefore thoroughly elaborated by ICRIOS to produce a cleaned and harmonized database:
  PATENTS-ICRIOS. Data process­ing consisted mainly in a thorough work of clean­ing
  and standardization of rough in­forma­tion provided by the EPO. \nSuch work of name
  standardization has been carried out at the level of individual inventors and applicants.\n\nIn
  addition to this, each patent document also reports further information not included
  in Patstat, (FI concordance tables to convert IPC codes into more aggregated and
  manageable technological classes). \n\nData included in these reports are for EPO
  patent office only; last update has been released on 10/2016; starting date for
  EPO applications is 1978, bytheway in many reports by priority date you'll meat
  earlier dates."
