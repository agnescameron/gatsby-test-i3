description: "The Artificial Intelligence Patent Dataset consists of two files, both\
  \ released by the OCE. The first data file identifies United States (U.S.) patents\
  \ issued between 1976 and 2020 and pre-grant publications (PGPubs) published through\
  \ 2020 that contain one or more of several AI technology components (including machine\
  \ learning, natural language processing, computer vision, speech, knowledge processing,\
  \ AI hardware, evolutionary computation, and planning and control). \n\nOCE generated\
  \ this data file using a machine learning (ML) approach that analyzed patent text\
  \ and citations to identify AI in U.S. patent documents. The second data file contains\
  \ the patent documents used to train the ML models."
