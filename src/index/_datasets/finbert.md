description: FinBERT is a pre-trained NLP model to analyze sentiment of financial
  text. It is built by further training the BERT language model in the finance domain,
  using a large financial corpus and thereby fine-tuning it for financial sentiment
  classification. Financial PhraseBank by Malo et al. (2014) is used for fine-tuning.
