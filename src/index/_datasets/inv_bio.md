description: 'We introduce the employer-employee inventor dataset INV-BIO ADIAB 1980-2014,
  which records complete biographies of more than 150,000 inventors in Germany between
  1980 and 2014. This dataset tracks each inventorâ€™s employment status and inventive
  output over time with high precision.


  Linked at the person level, the INV-BIO ADIAB data comprise about 150,000 inventors
  in Germany with daily information on their employment careers drawn from IAB data
  sources and detailed patent track records for inventions registered at the European
  Patent Office or the German Patent and Trademark Office, respectively. All inventors
  recorded in the INV-BIO ADIAB data filed at least one patent with the European Patent
  Office between 1999 and 2011 and were identified in the administrative labor market
  data of the IAB as employees and disambiguated using a combination of record linkage
  and machine learning methods.'
