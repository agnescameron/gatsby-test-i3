description: 'This data publication offers updated data about low-carbon energy technology
  (LCET) patents and citations links to the scientific literature. Compared to a previous
  version, it also contains data on biofuels and fuels from waste technologies. The
  updated version also contains the code (R-scripts) that have been used to (1) compile
  the data and (2) to reproduce the statistical analysis including figures and tables
  presented in the final paper Hötte, Pichler, Lafond (2021): "The rise of science
  in low-carbon energy technologies", RSER. DOI: 10.1016/j.rser.2020.110654. '
