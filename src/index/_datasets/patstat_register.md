This database contains bibliographic and legal event data on published European and Euro-PCT patent applications.

Like the core PATSTAT database, it is maintained by the EPO, however PATSTAT Register only contains information about patent applications at the European Patent Ofﬁce (EPO). The information in PATSTAT Register is, however, considerably deeper and more detailed.

Their example queries are reproduced below, and are also available [on GitHub](https://github.com/gderasse/patstat_register).


### 1. Identification of Patents by Technology Field

```sql
CREATE TABLE wind_patents AS 
SELECT 
   DISTINCT t1.appln_id 
FROM
   tls201_appln t1
      INNER JOIN
   tls209_appln_ipc t9 ON t1.appln_id = t9.appln_id
WHERE
   t1.appln_auth = 'EP'
      AND (t1.appln_kind = 'A' OR t1.appln_kind = 'W')
      AND year(t1.appln_filing_date) BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010
      AND t9.ipc_class_symbol LIKE 'F03D%'
```

### 2. Identification of Patents by Technology Field

```sql
SELECT
