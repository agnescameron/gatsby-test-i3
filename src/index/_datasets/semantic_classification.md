description: 'An open consolidated database from raw data on 4 million patents taken
  from the US patent office from 1976 onward. To build the pattern network, not only
  do we look at each patent title, but we also examine their full abstract and extract
  the relevant keywords accordingly. We refer to this classification as semantic approach
  in contrast with the more common technological approach which consists in taking
  the topology when considering US Patent office technological classes. '
