description: OpenRefine is a desktop application that uses your web browser as a graphical
  interface. It is described as “a power tool for working with messy data”. OpenRefine
  is most useful where you have data in a simple tabular format such as a spreadsheet,
  a comma separated values file (csv) or a tab delimited file (tsv) but with internal
  inconsistencies either in data formats, or where data appears, or in terminology
  used. OpenRefine can be used to standardize and clean data across your file, as
  well as performing more complex operations including entity reconciliation against
  external APIs.
