description: CiteSpace generates interactive visualizations of structural and temporal
  patterns and trends of a scientific field. It facilitates a systematic review of
  a knowledge domain through an in-depth visual analytic process. It can process citation
  data from popular sources such as the Web of Science, Scopus, Dimensions, and the
  Lens. CiteSpace also supports basic visual analytic functions for datasets without
  citation-related information, for example, PubMed, CNKI, ProQuest Dissertations
  and Theses. CiteSpace reveals how a field of research has evolved, what intellectual
  turning points are evident along a critical path, and what topics have attracted
  attention. CiteSpace can be applied repeatedly so as to track the development of
  a field closely and extensively.
