description: The PatentsView platform is built on a newly developed database that
  longitudinally links inventors, organizations, locations, and patenting activity
  since 1976. The data visualization tool, query tool, and flexible API enable a broad
  spectrum of users to examine the dynamics of inventor patenting activity over time
  and space. These tools also permit users to explore technology categories, assignees,
  citation patterns, and co-inventor networks.
