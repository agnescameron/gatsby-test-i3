description: CPC is the outcome of an ambitious harmonization effort to bring the
  best practices from the EPO and USPTO together. In fact, most U.S. patent documents
  are already classified in ECLA. The conversion from ECLA to CPC at the EPO will
  ensure IPC compliance and eliminate the need for the EPO to classify U.S. patent
  documents. At the USPTO, the conversion will provide an up-to date classification
  system that is internationally compatible.
